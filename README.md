#### Bank Aggregator

We use GoCradless to get the bank account data. It has a free tier and a lot of Bak Integratiob 
Other options are Plaid, Tink.io, powens.com, saltedge.
GoCardless is the best option for now as it is widely used and got a good free tier. ([Reddit Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/vosfinances/comments/1f3zw6j/liste_des_transactions_via_api_open_banking/)) 
PAr ailleurs, il existe d'autres projets open sources de open banking comme : [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/). It seems to use GoCardless and SaltEdge. 
The issue with gocardless, it's that i don't have a solution fror Natixis Inter√©pargne and Lydia. Tricount does not have an account in any case.
